## Welcome to The Second Summer School on Statistical Methods for Linguistics and Psychology, 2018, 10-14 September

## Summer School Location

[Griebnitzsee Campus, University of Potsdam, Germany](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/db/zeik-portal/gm/lageplan-up.php?komplex=3)

## About the summer school

The Second Summer School on Statistical Methods for Linguistics and Psychology will be held in Potsdam, Germany from **September 10-14 2018**. **Note that this summer school follows the annual international <a href="http://amor.cms.hu-berlin.de/~knoeferp/AMLaP2018/Home.html">AMLaP conference</a>, which will be held in Berlin September 6-8 2018**.

Like the first edition, this summer school will have a Bayesian and frequentist stream. Bayesian data analysis will be taught (first four days) by Michael Betancourt, who is one of the lead developers of Stan; he will be assisted by Bruno Nicenboim and Shravan Vasishth. The frequentist stream will be led by Reinhold Kliegl, Audrey Bürki, and Daniel Schad.
Both tracks will be aimed at linguists and psychologists, but are relevant for cognitive scientists working in many different areas. We will cover the necessary theoretical background for both statistical frameworks, and participants will get hands-on practice in learning to analyze real data sets.

The pace of this summer school will be intense! Participants should expect to be working hard during this one week, and to go home and review the materials after the course is over.

## Hour-by-hour schedule

This will appear in late August 2018.

## Curriculum

The summer school is intended for participants who have data analysis experience (especially, experience with linear mixed models is assumed), but want to work with state-of-the-art Bayesian and frequentist methods.
We will assume that participants should be comfortable with the material presented in [this article](https://github.com/vasishth/VasishthNicenboimPart1) and these [introductory lecture notes](https://github.com/vasishth/Statistics-lecture-notes-Potsdam/blob/master/IntroductoryStatistics/StatisticsNotesVasishth.pdf).

We will mainly focus on modeling repeated measures data. We will discuss hierarchical modeling in detail, using the generalized linear mixed modeling framework as a starting point. We will use [R](https://cran.r-project.org/), the lme4 package, and [Stan](mc-stan.org). Participants will be assumed to have a working knowledge of R; Stan will be taught from scratch. Everyone is expected to bring their own laptop computer.

The summer school will consist of lectures followed by hands-on exercises. 

### Bayesian stream: syllabus

Taught by [Michael Betancourt](https://betanalpha.github.io/) (10-13 Sept), [Bruno Nicenboim](http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/~nicenboim/), [Shravan Vasishth](http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/~vasishth/) (13-14 Sept)

This course is designed for people who want a fast entry into Bayesian data analysis and modeling using [Stan](mc-stan.org). The participants should be fairly familiar with linear modeling theory and should be experienced in fitting frequentist linear mixed models. 

- Foundations of Bayesian inference
- Bayesian computation and Markov Chain Monte Carlo
- Bayesian Modeling with Stan
- Regression modeling using Stan
- Hierarchical modeling using Stan
- Mixture models, Bayesian cognitive modeling, and other advanced topics

### Frequentist stream: syllabus

Taught by [Audrey Bürki](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/ling/staff-list/audreybuerki.html), [Daniel Schad](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Daniel_Schad), [Reinhold Kliegl](http://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/cognitive-psychology/staff/kliegl-reinhold.html)

This course is designed for researchers who are interested in fitting linear mixed models using the lme4 package in R, but are unsure about how to proceed with advanced topics such as model selection, contrast coding, and visualizing model fit.

- Review of linear modeling theory
- Introduction to linear mixed models
- Model selection
- Contrast coding and visualizing partial fixed effects
- Shrinkage and partial pooling

### Invited talks

We will have two invited talks during the summer school.

- [Sebastian Reich](http://www.math.uni-potsdam.de/~sreich/): Advanced lecture on Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
- [Joachim Vandekerckhove](http://web1.ss.uci.edu/~joachim/): Lecture title to be announced

## Preparation for summer school

We are assuming that participants will have a very good working knowledge of R and have considerable experience in fitting linear mixed models. Participants are expected to bring their own laptops. Wifi access will be available.

**Please make sure you have the current versions of R and RStudio installed on your computer by the time you start the summer school, and that you have the R packages rstan, brms, and rstanarm installed. To install rstan, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started).**

## Slides+code+data

Slides etc. will appear early Sept 2018.

### Location and registration

The summer school will be held at the Griebnitzsee campus of the University of Potsdam; this is about 15-20 minutes away from Berlin zoo station by train. Lectures will be held in Haus 6, Rooms S17 (Frequentist stream), S18 (Bayesian stream). Invited lectures will be held in Hoersaal H01.
